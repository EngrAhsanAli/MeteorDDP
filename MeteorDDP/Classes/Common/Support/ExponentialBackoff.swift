// MARK:- ðŸš€ MeteorDDP ExponentialBackoff - Retry connection requests to the server. The retries exponentially increase the waiting time up to a certain threshold. The idea is that if the server is down temporarily, it is not overwhelmed with requests hitting at the same time when it comes back up.
